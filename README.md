## Resources
### Data Source 
- 

### Software

## Results 

### Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, you’ll filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. You’ll then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.

- A working query is written to retrieve the June temperatures from the date column of the Measurement table. (10 pt)
- The temperatures are added to a list. (10 pt)
- The list of temperatures is converted to a Pandas DataFrame. (10 pt)
- Summary statistics are generated for the DataFrame. (10 pt)

### Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, you’ll filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of December. You’ll then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.

- A working query is written to retrieve the December temperatures from the date column of the Measurement table (10 pt)
- The temperatures are added to a list. (10 pt)
- The list of temperatures is converted to a Pandas DataFrame. (10 pt)
- Summary statistics are generated for the DataFrame. (10 pt)


There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December.


## Summary
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
